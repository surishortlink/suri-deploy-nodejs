# Suri Ã— Deploy with Node.js

You're viewing a template repository tailored for deploying Suri with Node.js.
That could be on a cloud platform that supports Node.js and/or serving static
sites, or just on your own machine.

What's Suri? Suri is your own link shortener that's easily deployed as a static
site. No server-side hosting, serverless cloud functions, or database necessary.
Head over to the main [`jstayton/suri`](https://github.com/jstayton/suri)
repository to learn more, including additional deployment methods.

## Setup

1. Click the "Use this template" button above and then "Create a new
   repository". Fill in the required details to create a new repository based on
   this one.
2. Make sure you have a compatible version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
   (see `engines.node` in [`package.json`](package.json)).
   [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is the recommended installation method
   on your own machine:

   ```bash
   nvm install --lts
   ```

3. Install dependencies with npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Build the static site:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Deploy the generated `build` directory to its final destination.

## Manage Links

Links are managed through [`./src/links.json`](./src/links.json), which is
seeded with a few examples to start:

```json
{
  "/": "https://github.com/jstayton/suri",
  "1": "https://fee.org/articles/the-use-of-knowledge-in-society/",
  "tw": "https://twitter.com"
}
```

It couldn't be simpler: the key is the "shortlink" path that gets redirected,
and the value is the target URL. Keys can be as short or as long as you want,
using whatever mixture of characters you want. `/` is a special entry for
redirecting the root path.

## Config

Config options are set in [`suri.config.json`](suri.config.json). There is only
one at this point:

| Option | Description                                                        | Type    | Default |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | ------- |
| `js`   | Whether to redirect with JavaScript instead of a `<meta>` refresh. | Boolean | `false` |
